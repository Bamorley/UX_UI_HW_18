                    <li>Designed an all-in-one resource hub for the Chicago Underwater Hockey team. Through user research, we identified key information that was missing from the Chicago Underwater Hockey website. We expanded their content and created an easy-to-follow site structure and design.</li>
                    <li>Restructured the content-dense Department of Labor website, which is currently overwhelming and difficult to navigate. I reworked the site structure and grouped content by categories to make it easier for users to quickly find what they need.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created a skin care app that made it easy for users to find eco-friendly, clean products that are produced by ethical companies.</li>
