        <h1>Diving into the World of Underwater Hockey </h1>
        <p>The Chicago Underwater Hockey Team is full of competitive individuals who love a crazy, niche sport. Since people don't grow up playing underwater hockey in gym class or at summer camps, recruiting new players can be difficult. It's oftentimes tough to convince someone to try a sport they've never heard of or seen. It's even more difficult to recruit players when you tell them that underwater hockey is played on the bottom of a pool and they need to hold their breath!</p>

            <h2>Why they reached out</h2>
            <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        </div>
        <p>The Chicago Underwater Hockey Team is a not-for-profit organization, and they do not have the budget to build a professional website. A board member requested that our team provide UX/UI recommendations to help improve their website and recruiting efforts.</p>
        <h3>Current Chicago Underwater Hockey Website</h3>
        <div class="oldSite">

            <h2>Kicking things off with user interviews</h2>
            <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Our team conducted five user interviews, focusing on three groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>UWH board members</li>
            <li>New players</li>
            <li>Potential players</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By interviewing a wide range of individuals, we were able to identify differing user needs. Although the website's primary purpose is for recruitment, new and current players also need resources to help them better understand the game and improve their skills. 
        </p>
        <div>
            <h2>Identifying user expectations</h2>
            <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="surveyResults">
            <p>We developed a comprehensive survey to better understand what people look for and expect to see on a club website. After analyzing the survey results, we identified the most commonly requested information.</p>
           <p>The current underwater hockey website provided only <strong>three of the seven items</strong>. This lack of information likely frustrates potential players, leaving them unsatisfied.</p>

            <h2>Choosing our “captain”</h2>
            <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Through user research, we identified three goals for the Chicago Underwater Hockey site:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Recruit new players who know little-to-nothing about the sport</li>
            <li>Provide new players easy-to-understand resources to help them improve their skills</li>
            <li>Offer veteran players advanced drills and workouts to take them to the next level</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Since the primary goal of the site is to aid recruitment efforts, we developed a user persona, Johanna, who represented our target audience.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The current site included four pages: Home, About, Gallery, and Contact.</p>
                <p>Our proposed site quadrupled their content, and it included commonly sought information such as practice times, pricing, and equipment information. It also included resources for current players, including positioning guides, drills, and workouts.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Whether it's the Bears, Cubs, or Blackhawks, Chicagoans love their sports teams. We knew it was important to the Chicago Underwater Hockey team that we represent their Chicago flag on our site. Our color scheme faithfully followed the official city of Chicago colors, while still maintaining accessibility with our color contrast choices.</p>
        <p>Through our user interviews, we learned that users found the current Chicago Underwater Hockey logo confusing. We simplified the logo and removed the hard-to-read copy.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Diving into designs and iterations</h2>
            <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        </div>
        <div>

            <img src="images/final-homepage.png">
        </div>
        <p>After user testing, we significantly revamped our homepage. We realized that our homepage had strayed from the original purpose of the site—recruitment. We needed to reformat the content to make sure that we made it incredibly easy for prospective players to find the information they needed.</p>
        <p>For that reason, we</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moved the “Resources” section lower since that section was targeted to current players.</li>
            <li>Changed the “Connect with Us” section to an “Are You New Here” progress bar.</li>
            <li>Added a schedule button to the “What the Puck” section.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <h2>The Winning Design</h2>
            <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/final-design.png">
            <button class="primaryButton">DESKTOP PROTOTYPE</button>
            <button class="secondaryButton">MOBILE PROTOTYPE</button>

        <div>
            <h2>End of regulation</h2>
            <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        </div>
        <h3>Future iterations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create an alert banner that would notify players of practice cancellations.</li>
            <li>Continue user testing the homepage, in particular the four-step process. If this testing goes well, add “Are You New Here” progress bar added to all beginner pages.</li>
            <li>Iterate the “Rules of the Game” desktop page to make it clear for users that each section is scrollable.</li>
            <li>A/B split test “Resources” vs “Current Players” to identify which is easier to understand.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We made design decisions, such as the Chicago star divider lines, that may be difficult to replicate if you don't have experience with coding or developing websites. Chicago Underwater Hockey would need to simplify some pages before implementing our designs.</li>
            <li>As currently designed, the schedule page would require a significant amount of time update and maintain. In retrospect, we could have simplified the design and included a monthly calendar with a PDF download option. </li>
